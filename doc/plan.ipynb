    "# Project Roadmap: Quantum Control & Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goal:** Characterize a Transmon qubit as a driven damped harmonic oscillator using Pulse-level control.  \n",
    "> **Status:** 🚧 In Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates the workflow of a Quantum Engineer calibrating a superconducting quantum processor. The roadmap is divided into two phases: **Control Calibration** (finding the signal) and **Noise Characterization** (analyzing the quality).\n",

    "## Week 1: Signal Discovery & Control Calibration\n",
    "**Objective:** Tune the control pulses to match the qubit's resonance frequency and calibrate the amplitude for a perfect bit-flip ($X_{\\pi}$ gate).\n",

    "- [y] **Environment Setup:** Install `qiskit`, `qiskit-experiments`, and visualization tools.\n",
